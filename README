This is a color scheme with light-gray background ideal for programming. Highlighted items have dark colors to please the eyes but provide enough contrast to distinguish between them.
Vim7 highlight groups are supported, e.g. tab line, completion menu, spelling, and paren matching.
Together with the ShowPairs plugin (vimscript #626) this color scheme provides highlighting for being inside matching parens (light green background) or exactly on a paren (emphasized light green background).
Works for GUI and CTerm.
